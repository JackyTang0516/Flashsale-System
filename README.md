## Key Features and Technologies

### High Scalability: 
- Leveraging the power of Java and Spring Boot, the system is engineered to scale seamlessly with increasing traffic demands.

### Data Replication and Caching:

- Implemented data replication from MySQL to Redis.
- Adopted Lua Script for optimized data processing.
- Cached essential goods information, significantly reducing data access latency.
- Achieved a reduction in server response time, enhancing overall performance.

### Performance Enhancement with RocketMQ:

- Integrated RocketMQ for efficient message queuing.
- Employed cache warm-up strategies and asynchronous processing.
- Resulted in an increase in user traffic, demonstrating the system's capacity to handle larger user bases effectively.

### Flow Control and Rate Limiting with Sentinel:

- Utilized Sentinel for sophisticated flow control and rate limiting.
- Managed a high-performance, multithreading web server capable of handling over 600 Queries Per Second (QPS).

## How to start:
### 1. Start MySQL and initilized the tables:
```
 sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start
```
- password:12345678, configure the application.properties and generatorConfig.xml
  
- Run seckill_activity.sql to create the tables

### 2. Start Redis by running the following commands in the directory:
```
redis-server
```
### 3. Start RocketMQ by running following commands in the directory:
```
nohup sh bin/mqnamesrv 
```
```
nohup sh bin/mqbroker -n localhost:9876 
```
```
cat nohup.out
```
### 4. Redirect to the homepage:
```
localhost:8080/seckills
```

- The port can be configured in application.properties.

### * To restart RocketMQ, run the following commands in the directory:
```
sh bin/mqshutdown broker
```
```
sh bin/mqshutdown namesrv
```
### * To restart Nacos:
```
sh startup.sh -m standalone
```
```
sh shutdown.sh        
```

### * To set the messageDelayLevels for locked-items(before payment is successful):
- 1s 5s 10s 30s 1m 2m 3m 4m 5m 6m 7m 8m 9m 10m 20m 30m 1h 2h
- rocketMQService.sendDelayMessage("pay_check", JSON.toJSONString(order), 4);

## Stress Testing (using JMeter)
- Open the terminal then run:
```
jmeter
```
